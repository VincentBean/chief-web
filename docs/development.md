# Development

Requires Node.js 22+.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev          # API on :8080 (tsx watch)
npm run dev -w web   # UI on :5173, proxying /api to :8080
```

Quality checks — these must pass before every commit:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```

A production build (`npm run build`) compiles the server to `server/dist` and the
frontend to `web/dist`; `npm start` then serves both from a single port.
